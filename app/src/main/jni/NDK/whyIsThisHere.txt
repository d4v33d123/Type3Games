-header taken from the NDK folder at:
	toolchains\arm-linux-androideabi-4.8\prebuilt\lib\gcc\arm-linux-androideabi\4.8\include

-needed to properly compile Type3Engine's picoPNG.cpp
(constains compiler specific definitions of size_t and other things referenced in that file)

-Yes, I could have included it directly from the ndk folder instead of copying it here,
but that folder is outside the project's folder and I found it was annoying to include from
../../../../../../android-ndk-r10e/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.8/prebuilt/lib/gcc/arm-linux-androideabi/4.8/include,
plus other obvious path maintenance related problems when moving stuff around
